  ## Description
  A budget tracker built using MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Express and IndexedDB to provide client-side storage. The application falls under the Progressive Web Applications(PWA) standards as it is designed for mobile first and uses Service Workers to intercept any and all requests from the client so as to cache or retrieve from the cache. 

  ## Installation
  Simply clone the repo or click directly on the heroku link to use the application from the browser immediately. If running from the CLI, install the necessary packages and run from NPM start to open the server. 

  ## Usage
  The site is fairly simple and direct; provide the name of the transaction and the transaction amount then add or subtract from the budget. As transactions are added, the graph will alter to present a detailed scale of budget spending.
